# Circuit-Solver
A simple circuit solver with GUI

Technology needed:

-Python 3

-Install numpy module (pip install numpy)

This is a circuit solver that solves an arbitrary circuit involving voltage sources, current sources, and resistors. 

Open the file "final code.py", and directly execute the file (or open a terminal to the directory, and type "python app.py"). Users can drag and drop components onto the grid system, and press "solve" button to get the result. They can also press "demo" button to view the current flow in the circuit.
